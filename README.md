This is my first React project for my internship. It demonstrates how to use props and state in React by building a dynamic profile card app.

Features:

- Display profile cards with name, bio, and picture
- Follow/Unfollow button for each user
- Light/Dark mode toggle
- Search bar to filter users by name
- Multiple cards visible on the screen at once
- Pictures stored in the assets folder (custom images)

- How state makes the UI interactive and dynamic
